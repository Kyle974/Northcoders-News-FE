# Northcoders-News-FE

Welcome to NC-News!

NC-News is a news site similar to Reddit in it's functionality.
Here are a list of implemented features for you to try out:

• you can view a list of all articles on the home page

• you can sort article list by using the tabs at the top of the screen (hottest: most comments, best: most upvoted, newest: most recent timestamp)

• you can login to a user account (the username 'jessjelly' will automatically appear in this login form in the top right, no password needed)

• once you're logged in you can added upvote or downvote articles and comments, add new comments, and delete comments (but only those authored by the current logged in user)
